Data imputation scripts and notebooks related to [FIREMAN project](https://fireman-project.eu/) and main [FIREMAN-project repository](https://github.com/5uperpalo/FIREMAN-project/).
Reporsitory is a work-in-progress project that is part of FIREMAN project activities. Currently it includes GAIN object oriented impelementation using PyTorch and its integration with Raytune distributed parameter searching framework.

## install:
```
python setup.py install
```

## run tests:
```
pip install -r test-requirements.txt
python -m pytest
```

## documentation:
Automatic HTML documenation generated by sphinx is viewable at [Doc](https://github.com/5uperpalo/FIREMAN-project_imputation/blob/main/docs/_build/html/index.html) and version viewable on github using BitBucket at [Doc-git](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/5uperpalo/FIREMAN-project_imputation/blob/main/docs/_build/html/index.html)(you have to wait couple of seconds until theme comes up).


### generate new documenation (app\docs):
Under docs/:
```
pip install -r doc-requirements.txt
make html
```
