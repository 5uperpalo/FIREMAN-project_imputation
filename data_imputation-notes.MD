* MCAR (missing completely at random)– the probability that a variable value is missing doesnot depend on the observed data values nor on the missing data values [i.e., p(missing|com-plete data)¼p(missing)]. The missingness pattern results from a process completely unre-lated to the variables in one’s analyses, or from a completely random process (similar toflipping a coin or rolling a die).
* MAR (‘‘missing at random’’)– the probability that a variable value is missing partly dependson other data that are observed in the dataset, but does not depend on any of the values thatare missing [i.e., p(missing|complete data)¼p(missing|observed data)].
* MNAR (missing not at random)– the probability that a variable value is missing depends onthe missing data values themselves [i.e., p(missing|complete data)6¼p(missing|observeddata)].
